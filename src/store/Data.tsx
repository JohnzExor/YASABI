    title: `Implementation of a Comprehensive Driver Behavior Reporting System for Transportation Industry.`,
    projectType: `The objective of this project is to create an extensive system that tracks and provides insights 
      into the conduct of motorists in the Philippines. This system will encompass multiple facets of driver behavior, 
      including compliance with traffic regulations, promoting road safety, and encouraging responsible driving practices. 
      It will serve as a valuable tool for government bodies, law enforcement agencies, or private enterprises with a keen 
      focus on fostering safe and responsible driving habits.`,
    projectDate: `This study was undertaken as part of our coursework for the subject of System Integration and Architecture, 
      which constitutes our final academic requirement. I dedicated the entire month of May in the current year to conducting this 
      research and completing the project. Meanwhile, in this case study I started working this on the end of September, I estimated 
      this to finish on October or November.`,
    role: `I am responsible for a wide range of tasks as part of the Comprehensive Driver Behavior Reporting System project. First, 
      I'll conduct extensive research to understand the specific needs of the transportation industry in the Philippines. 
      In addition, I'll take the lead in designing the user interface, with a focus on making it user-friendly and intuitive. 
      I will also be responsible for testing, documentation, project coordination, and client communication. This demonstrates 
      my ability to work independently and manage various aspects of the project effectively.`,
    summary: `The Comprehensive Driver Reporting System project was created in response to the urgent need for a customized solution 
      in the Philippine transportation sector. It intends to address issues of road safety and defensive driving techniques by developing 
      a user-friendly interface for tracking and reporting driver behavior. The impetus for this project came from alarming national 
      statistics on traffic infractions and accidents, which highlighted the need for an effective reporting system. The main goal is 
      to build a comprehensive platform that allows users to report incidents, enforce traffic laws, and promote safer roads. Through 
      this project, I hope to demonstrate my UI/UX design and development skills while also significantly improving road safety in the 
      Philippines.`,

    title: "Optimization of Canvas Website’s UI to Improve User Experience",
    summary: `As of now a plethora of schools and universities use canvas to give task, provide resources, and communicate to students, the 
      interface’s learning curve should be low so that students can focus more on their task rather than having a hard time locating 
      where resources are because of the unfamiliar platform and confusing. The improvement and redesign of the interface can improve 
      the overall user experience when using the product.  Redundancies exist in the product and the goal is to reduce if not remove 
      it completely.`,

      "NoteXpert: Optimizing Teacher Workflows using a Cross- Platform Class Scheduling with Note-taking system",
    summary: `The"NoteXpert" is a project focused on revolutionizing teacher workflows
      through the integration of a Cross-Platform Class Scheduling with Note-taking
      system. This project is designed to streamline administrative processes for teachers, allowing them to allocate more time to teaching and less on scheduling tasks.
      Inspired by the need for a more efficient and intuitive educational tool, NoteXpert
      aims to provide a seamless experience for teachers. The project's ultimate goal is to
      enhance the teaching experience by giving them space for productivity, ensuring
      that teachers have the resources they need to deliver quality education effectively. The anticipated results include improved time management, organized schedules, enhanced communication, fair distribution of classes, and increased flexibility in
      scheduling and allowing teachers to note, such as in text, images, and file for better
      work flow. NoteXpert is poised to be a game-changer in the field of education
      technology, other features that could be seen in this project are, class schedule
      notification, student grades calculation and attendance, and show who passed and
      failed.`,

      "An Online Rental Space Management System for small or family owned rental spaces.",
    summary: `OuRSpace is a proposed project aimed to help small and/or family owned rental space business to 
      manage, maintain, and automate the workflow when it comes to managing a rental space business. It is 
      aimed to be a cheaper alternative management system that caters mainly to small and/or family owned 
      rental space business that is easier to use than corporate-type management systems that needs a 
      dedicated IT department to run, costing small businesses to spend more but only needing a fraction of 
      the features included for their businesses. I proposed this idea to the group as a project because we used 
      to rent a space for our business on a family owned rental space, and throughout the time we were there, 
      I observed that they use pen and paper for most transactions, and manually inputting their records on an 
      excel sheet, which in my opinion takes a lot of time, and when problems arises that needs the owners to 
      backlog, some data might already be lost or inconsistencies may rise. Thus with this, managing a rental 
      space business can become easier, and data queries to be faster.`,
